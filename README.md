# Login-System

User authentication is very common in modern web application. It is a security mechanism that is used to restrict unauthorized access to member-only areas and tools on a site.

In this project you can learn how to create a simple registration and login system using the PHP and MySQL. This tutorial is comprised of two parts: in the first part we'll create a user registration form, and in the second part we'll create a login form, as well as a welcome page and a logout script.

## Requirements
<ul>
  <li>WAMP/LAMP/XAMP</li>
  <li>PHP Editor eg. Sublime Text3,notepad++,etc.</li>
</ul>

# Setup
<ol>
  <li>First we need to create a table that will hold all the user data. So simply import loginsystem.sql to your MySql server.</li>
  <li>Keep All the php files and css folder under one parent folder and move that parent folder in www folder of WAMP and HTPDocs in XAMPP.</li>
  <li>For executing the system turn your WAMP server ON and search localhost/path/login.php</li>
 </ol>
